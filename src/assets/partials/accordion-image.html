                <h3 class="accordion__label">Why a website is important</h3>
                <p class="accordion__content">A website gives your product an online presence. Whether you wish to
                    promote your business, or showcase your work for employment opportunities, having an online presence
                    can help people discover your product, business or even you as an individual. Not only this, but it
                    is an opportunity to show people what the quality of what you offer whether that's the beautiful
                    latte art on your coffee or the way you can revamp some copywriting. You can also share important
                    information such as an address, opening hours or contact deals.</p>

                <h3 class="accordion__label">Why use Ambedo</h3>
                <p class="accordion__content">Ambedo is my personal freelancing business. I myself have several years of
                    commercial web development experience for well known clients from when I was working in a web
                    agency. I've worked on a variety of projects and met a range of client needs in the process. I can
                    develop a website in an organised and efficient manner at a smaller cost, whilst also advising on
                    what will and won't be worthwhile developing into the site. <a href="https://hoggsofwar.netlify.app/portfolio-commercial.html">(click here for my person site showing examples of my web builds in a web agency.)</a></p>

                <h3 class="accordion__label">Do you know your vision</h3>
                <p class="accordion__content">So you've decided you want to request a website using Ambedo? That's
                    great! Some information that would be great to think about would be, what is your brand? Do you have
                    an existing site you want remade into something more modern? Do you have a design for me to work
                    from, or inspiration from other websites you like? How many pages would you like it to have and what
                    do you most want to achieve with the website?</p>
